# New Feature
We are proud to announce a new feature that our NCI Quality Assurance Team in California will be glad to see:

### More descriptive file names for Incentive Packet downloads
To date, the names of the .zip files that are generated when our QA team approves and downloads an Incentive Packet (for handing off to the program implementer) have been subpar to say the least.  Subpar naming conventions have led to unnecessary rework on the QA Team's behalf and just adds frustration to a surprisingly complex process.

So we fixed that.

##### Example
When there is an Incentive Packet with the following information:
- Company Name (Testing Organization): "ABC Heating and Air Conditioning"
- Location Name: "Applebee's #1234"
- Date Approved: "July 4, 2016"

Then the Incentive Packet Download .zip file will be named
**__abc_heating_and_air_conditioning-applebees_#1234-070416.zip__**
