#ComfortMaxx-Salesforce Integration

Looking into connecting ComfortMaxx to our Salesforce Org's database.

## RESTforce Gem
[RESTforce gem](https://github.com/ejholmes/restforce)

It looks like we can simply set up a relationship with the instantiated Hashie::Mash objects and check everything we need to directly without having to sync or make HTTP Requests.

May want to figure out how that will affect the API Calls limit though!  Probably going to destroy our API Call limit :/
